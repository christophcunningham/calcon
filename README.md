# Calc\*on

A Sumlock-style running total calculator with memory recall chips. A dual scroll-wheel unit converter and fraction-aware calculator — built for people who work with various measurements every day. Designed with a bit of a 90s aesthetic, with a hope to bring a fun and tactile way to input measurements
